For example- when prompted to recommend papers on explainability, it said the paper \"Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of Machine Learning\" is by Zach Lipton, which in fact, is written by Gilpin et al. and does not have Zach as an author. This potentially hints at misinformation. It made similar mistakes when asking for papers on privacy, interpretability, and adversarial ML. \n The results can be reproduced by using the prompt \"Can you recommend any papers on explainability?\"."
